    "\n",
    "Identifiers may only begin with an underscore (_) or a letter, not numbers. Therefore, myvar or my_var is valid, 1var is invalid.\n",

    "Identifiers may consist of numbers, letters, and underscores, no other characters. So, for example, we can have python_101 or _python101, but we cannot have $python$ because the $ sign is invalid.\n",

    "There is no limit on the length of an identifier name, although keeping them concise is recommended.\n",

    "We cannot use any Python keywords as an identifier name. They are reserved words for use by Python for specific purposes. "
